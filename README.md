# python-efficiency-lab

A workspace to experiment and learn about Python optimizations as well as write up minimal implementations of common algorithms and data structures.

### Example Applications:

  1. **What's the most efficient way to read an image from disk?**
  2. **What's the most efficient way to parse BBoxes into ndarray labels?**
  3. **What's the most efficient way to perform string manipulations?**
  4. **Is str.contains() slower or faster than re.search()?**
