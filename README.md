# python-efficiency-lab

A workspace to experiment and learn about Python optimizations.

**Example Applications:**

    1. **What's the most efficient way to read an image from disk?**
    2. **What's the most efficient way to parse BBoxes into ndarray labels?**
    3. **What's the most efficient way to perform string manipulations?**
    4. **Is str.contains() slower or faster than re.search()?**

**To do items:**

    [ ] read through old timer code
    [ ] implement desired timing code for a single simple comparison
    [ ] abstract timing code into easy-to-use interface
    [ ] Write documentation for the interface
    [ ] Test the implementation
